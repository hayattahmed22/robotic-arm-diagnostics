Robotic Arm Control System Diagnostics and Optimization
Overview
This repository contains a diagnostic and optimization notebook developed for a simulated surgical robotic arm control system. The notebook analyzes the performance of key commands (move_arm, rotate_joint, and adjust_grip), identifies potential delays, and implements targeted optimizations to improve real-time responsiveness. The project simulates a real-world engineering scenario where precise and immediate control is critical for surgical accuracy and patient safety.
