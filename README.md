# Robotic Arm Control System Diagnostics and Optimization

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains a diagnostic and optimization notebook for a surgical robotic arm control system. The notebook analyzes the performance of key commands (`move_arm`, `rotate_joint`, and `adjust_grip`), identifies potential delays or inefficiencies, and applies code optimizations to enhance real-time responsiveness.  

The project simulates a real-world scenario where precise and immediate control is critical for surgical accuracy and patient safety.
