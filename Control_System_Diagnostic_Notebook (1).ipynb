        "\n",
        "- Diagnose the root cause of delays in command response times.\n",
        "- Optimize control code for improved performance.\n",
        "- Document your findings and propose actionable solutions.\n",

        "Follow the steps outlined in this notebook to diagnose and resolve issues in the robotic arm's control system:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Load Libraries**: Run the provided setup code to load necessary Python libraries.\n",
        "2. **Run Diagnostic Functions**: Use the `check_response_time` function to measure command response times.\n",
        "3. **Analyze Findings**: Record observed delays and propose a hypothesis for their cause.\n",
        "4. **Test Optimizations**: Apply optimization logic and compare results.\n",
        "5. **Record Results**: Summarize your findings and recommendations in a structured format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus on the `rotate_joint` command, as it has been flagged for delays.\n"

        "- Continue monitoring to ensure consistent performance over time.\n",
        "- Conduct stress testing under simulated high-load scenarios to confirm reliability.\n",
        "- Regularly review code to maintain optimized performance and prevent regressions."
